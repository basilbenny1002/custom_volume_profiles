# Custom Volume Profiles  
Easily save and load audio volume settings for different applications, tailored to your needs. Whether you're gaming, listening to music, or attending meetings, switch seamlessly between profiles without the hassle of manual adjustments.

## Features  
- Save custom volume profiles for running applications.  
- Load saved profiles with a single click.  
- Adjust master volume as part of the profile.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-use GUI.  

## Motivation  
This project was inspired by a common frustration: manually adjusting Spotify and game volumes every time I played *Forza Horizon 5* and restoring them afterward. Balancing engine sounds with music was tedious, and finding the perfect volume mix involved trial and error. I wanted a solution that would simplify this process, save time, and let me enjoy my activities without interruptions.

## How It Works  
1. Open all the apps you want to adjust.  
2. Use the system volume mixer to set the desired levels.  
3. Save the settings as a profile with a custom name.  
4. Load the profile anytime to instantly apply the saved audio levels.
